\section{Methodology}

In this section, describe the approach or methodology you used in your research. Explain any algorithms, models, or techniques you implemented. If applicable, provide any theoretical background necessary to understand your methodology.

Be sure to explain any datasets, experiments, or simulations you conducted, including how the data was collected and preprocessed.

% Example:
% We propose a hybrid approach combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for time-series image prediction. The model is trained on the XYZ dataset, which consists of...
