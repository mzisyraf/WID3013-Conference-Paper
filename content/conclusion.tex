\section{Conclusion}

This research combined both 2D object detection and monocular depth estimation for guiding a robotic arm in performing pick-and-place tasks, especially a cup. The paper proposes a method that leverages the advantage of low-budget monocular cameras and real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model. The experimental results showed that  this model has a very high precision and recall value for object detection. Despite promising results, challenges such as computational resources and image quality requirements highlight the need for better resource and cost effective approaches to robotics in dynamic environments. This implementation opens up further opportunities for researching robotic automation tasks using better hardware and processing capabilities.

% Example:
% In this paper, we proposed a new approach to image classification using hybrid CNN and RNN models. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional CNN-based models in terms of accuracy and processing time. Future work could explore incorporating more advanced techniques, such as attention mechanisms, to further improve performance.
