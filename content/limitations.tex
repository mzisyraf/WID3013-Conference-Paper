\section{Limitation}
Include limitations here

\subsection{Dependency on Image Quality}
The accuracy of both object detection and depth estimation is very sensitive to the quality of input images. The performance of the system can significantly be degraded by low-resolution images, poor lighting conditions, motion blur and occlusions. For example, YOLOv8â€™s object detection and depth estimation model will struggle to extract precise depth details in images with overexposed or underexposed lighting, hence dropping the accuracy. This limitation emphasizes the need for robust pre-processing techniques and the capability of a model to adapt to challenging visual environments.

\subsection{Computational Resource Requirements}
Powerful computational resources are essential for a combination of frameworks like object detection and depth estimation especially in real-time application. Though YOLOv8 is readily optimized for speed, having depth estimation incorporated alongside it amplifies the computational burden. This limitation is vital for deployment on devices that are limited from resources such as drones, mobile platforms, or embedded systems. However, it can be overcome by implementing efficient hardware acceleration such as high-end GPUs or specialized AI processors
