\section{Related Work}
In robotic systems, object detection and depth estimation are critical as they enable robotic arms to perform pick and place tasks. Accurate perception of the objectâ€™s location and its distance are essential for efficient and precise manipulation. Recent studies have focused on integrating these two tasks to streamline robotic workflows and improve operational accuracy. 
Below, we explore key approaches in these domains, emphasizing their strengths, weaknesses and relevance to our work.

\subsection{Object Detection}
For the robotic arm to be able to identify and localize objects within a scene, Object Detection must be a vital component. Traditionally, researchers use classical computer vision to do object detection but over time, the object detection methods have evolved to advanced deep learning-based models.
