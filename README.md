# How to fill up content for the paper

## Content
1. Check if the heading you want to insert content into already has a **.tex** file under the content folder
2. If yes, fill up the content there. If not, create a new .tex file under the content folder with the heading related to the content (ex: methodology.tex)

## References and citation
1. Store references in **references.bib** under the content folder. Follow the sample contained in there
2. In-text citation can be done by using **\cite{reference_name}** as long as the reference_name has been included in the references.bib
